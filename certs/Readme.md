# Development certificates

The certificates provided in this folder are only intended for development needs and **should NOT be used in production**. These certificates are used for signing JWT tokens issued by the authentication API. They should be replaced by the certificates used for serving https requests by the production webserver. 

## Required files for API function
The authentication API depends on the `private.key` and `public.pem` files to sign JWT tokens. 


## Generating development certificates

New certificates for development webservers can be generated by running the following command:

```
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout private.key -out public.crt
```

The `.pem` file required by the application can be generated by running the following command:

```
$ openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in public.crt  > public.pem
```
